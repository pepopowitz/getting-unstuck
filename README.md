## Talk Description

You’ve followed along with the docs. Everything seems like it should be working. You’ve looked over this code 20 times, but you can’t figure out why it’s not working. You’re frustrated, and you’re ready to give up.

Even with the simplest of problems, we can get stuck. It happens to all of us - to new hires and senior engineers alike. The key to success as a developer is knowing how to get yourself unstuck.

We’ll look at several strategies for breaking through when it seems like you’ve hit an impenetrable wall. These strategies will help you understand, explain, and isolate the problem. Most importantly, they’ll help you move on.

Getting unstuck is a skill. This session will help you sharpen that skill, and prepare you for the next time you hit a wall.
