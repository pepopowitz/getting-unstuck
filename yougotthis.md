# you got this!

- 25 minute talk
- 10 minute questions (curated)
- can run over

I'm last

- [x] survey: give Kevin the question ahead of time + options, and he'll post it in the

- [x] re: protege effect - can I find a more practical example (e.g. writing a blog post & filling in the pieces that help explain it)

- [x] back out your changes iteratively can be a footnote on the previous slide

- [x] write tests -- this is a single point, not multiple slides
      i can bring in the lego camper for this to say that tests will help me pinpoint which of the components doesn't work, and which one does

- [x] simplify 4/5 stages of creativity -- one slide to mention it, don't get to deep

- [n] escape strategies - another way to slice it is get away from screen vs stay in front of screen

- [x] wall of motivation -- also called a brag doc in 2020's you got this (mention that it's watchable in the talk library)
