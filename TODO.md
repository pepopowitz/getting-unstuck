## Quick wins

- C# REPL's: CSI (ships with VS), ScriptCS

- Ellie REPL for Elm

- You're stuck because your mental model is **wrong**. Taking a break forces you to rebuild it, potentially correctly this time.

- Don't go through REPL's 1 by 1 - bulleted lists are fine for this.

* similar to wall of motivation & journaling - https://github.com/kamranahmedse/git-standup - shows you your commits for the last N days, to remind you that you are getting stuff done

* Mention near wall of motivation about being a good developer.

## Maybe later
