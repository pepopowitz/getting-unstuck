## Keep a journal

Notes:

Another of my coworkers, Eloy, who lives on a houseboat in Amsterdam,

recommended when I first started at Artsy to keep a journal

of things I did every day - so I could see that I **AM** getting things done.

I **AM** getting unstuck, and solving problems, and contributing.

Hardens your problem solving skills & persistence.

## Talk about your struggles

Notes:

Get outside of your head.

Do more active 1on1's with your leader, or someone else that you feel psychologically safe around.

Someone you can be vulnerable with.

Talk about the times you felt stuck.
