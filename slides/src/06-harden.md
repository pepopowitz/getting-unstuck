## Wall of motivation

Notes:

I keep a trello board, to remind myself that I'm succeeding at my job.

Whatever measures as a win to you

For me it's messages of really helping people

praise I've gotten from workshops and talks and my performance

And times when I've showed great perseverance.

## Keep a journal

Notes:

Another of my coworkers, Eloy, who lives on a houseboat in Amsterdam,

recommended when I first started at Artsy to keep a journal

of things I did every day - so I could see that I **AM** getting things done.

Sometimes they aren't things I can check off a list,

they are times when I knew I was doing my job of solving problems.

## Exercise

Notes:

Can reduce anxiety & depression

I particularly recommend rock climbing

Hardens your problem solving skills & persistence.

## Meditation

Notes:

Variety of mental & physical benefits

Especially leveling your emotions, which can factor into getting stuck

and increases your ability to persist through challenges

## Talk about your struggles

Notes:

Get outside of your head.

Do more active 1on1's with your leader, or someone else that you feel psychologically safe around.

Someone you can be vulnerable with.

Talk about the times you felt stuck.
