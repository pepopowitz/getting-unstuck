Trail: 3. Escape, Relax, Why?

TODO - illustrate how changing context helps your brain explore new ideas

http://mentalfloss.com/article/52586/why-do-our-best-ideas-come-us-shower
A. In creativity research, we refer to the three Bs—for the bathtub, the bed and the bus—places where ideas have famously and suddenly emerged. When we take time off from working on a problem, we change what we're doing and our context, and that can activate different areas of our brain. If the answer wasn't in the part of the brain we were using, it might be in another. If we're lucky, in the next context we may hear or see something that relates—distantly—to the problem that we had temporarily put aside.

Similar effects to resting - our brain explores new ideas

this is a very individualized strategy - ash plays guitar

Trail: 3. Escape

## Move on to another problem

Notes:

Put this one aside. Work on something else you know how to solve. 2 things can happen:

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Move On, Why?

### Your brain might come up with the answer while thinking about other things

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Move On, Why?

### When you come back to the original problem, you have to re-learn it a bit

Notes:

This can help you challenge assumptions, like talking to the duck.

## Analogical problem solving

TODO: illustrate this

Notes:

use information from one domain (the source or analogy)

to help solve a problem in another domain (the target)

mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

popularized "flow"
wrote a book called creativity

incubation - the idea that the brain works on problems once you've walked away from them
https://traviswhitecommunications.com/2012/12/26/creativity-in-five-steps/

    Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi — while not guaranteeing results — writes that creativity typically evolves through five stages.

      The first stage is preparation. Basically, you need to know the rules before you break them. Thomas Kuhn writes that scientific paradigms reflect a basic consensus of how the world operates. Prior to Copernicus, the astronomical paradigm held that the earth was the center of the universe. Before Copernicus could change the paradigm, he had to immerse himself in it. Only then could he make the observations that changed the paradigm.

      The second phase is incubation, “… during which ideas churn around below the threshold of consciousness.” This is when I like to go for a walk. I like to lay things aside, clear my head, and let my mind wander. It’s a haphazard process — sometimes nothing happens. Sometimes I simply forget what I was thinking about. Other times, however, something bubbles up that’s worth capturing. (One of the reasons I write this blog is to double back on my own thinking, recall what I wrote months ago, and perhaps make connections I would otherwise miss).

      Third, is the insight — the Aha moment. As we saw in the article on sleepiness and creativity (click here), focusing intently on the problem at hand may actually inhibit the Aha experience. When you focus, you block out random thoughts and stray ideas. But it’s those very thoughts and ideas that may produce the insight. When you’re tired — or when you can induce your mind to wander — those stray thoughts are not blocked out and can help you see things more creatively.

    From "Creativity":
      The distinction between serial and parallel processing of information may also explain what happens during incubation. In a serial system like that of an old-fashioned calculator, a   complex numerical problem must be solved in a sequence, one step at a time. In a parallel system such as in advanced computer software, a problem is broken up into its component steps, the partial computations are carried out simultaneously, and then these are reconstituted into a single final solution. Something similar to parallel processing may be taking place when the elements of a problem are said to be incubating. When we think consciously about an issue, our previous training and the effort to arrive at a solution push our ideas in a linear direction, usually along predictable or familiar lines. But intentionality does not work in the subconscious. Free from rational direction, ideas can combine and pursue each other every which way. Because of this freedom, original connections that would be at first rejected by the rational mind have a chance to become established.

    This ^^ is really similar to talking about asynchrony in code.

    Often when we're faced with a difficult problem, we think we need to really focus on it.

    We think that we are procrastinating if we aren't actively attacking it.

    But the truth is, for really complicated problems, where your brain and your creativity need to expand in many directions to find a solution, staying actively focused can be a detriment. Giving your brain some room to explore the space, on its own time, can help you explore ideas that your focused, rational mind would initially reject.

    So go for a walk. Go work out. Take a shower, or a nap. Read a book about something unrelated. Get in your basement and do some woodworking. Knit. Go mountain biking or trail running or rock climbing. Let your brain expand this problem in many other directions.
