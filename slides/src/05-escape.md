Trail: 3. Escape, Relax, Why?

TODO - illustrate how changing context helps your brain explore new ideas

Notes:

http://mentalfloss.com/article/52586/why-do-our-best-ideas-come-us-shower
A. In creativity research, we refer to the three Bs—for the bathtub, the bed and the bus—places where ideas have famously and suddenly emerged. When we take time off from working on a problem, we change what we're doing and our context, and that can activate different areas of our brain. If the answer wasn't in the part of the brain we were using, it might be in another. If we're lucky, in the next context we may hear or see something that relates—distantly—to the problem that we had temporarily put aside.

Notes:

Similar effects to resting - our brain explores new ideas

this is a very individualized strategy - ash plays guitar

## Move on to another problem

Notes:

Put this one aside. Work on something else you know how to solve. 2 things can happen:

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Move On, Why?

### Your brain might come up with the answer while thinking about other things

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Move On, Why?

### When you come back to the original problem, you have to re-learn it a bit

Notes:

This can help you challenge assumptions, like talking to the duck.

## Analogical problem solving

TODO: illustrate this

Notes:

use information from one domain (the source or analogy)

to help solve a problem in another domain (the target)

http://cognitivepsychology.wikidot.com/problem-solving:analogy

...

This happens when you notice parallels between two very different activities;

this prompts you to notice OTHER parallels between them

which can include a reframing of the problem in a way you hadn't before.

## Incubation

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

## 4 Stages of Creativity

1. Preparation
2. Incubation
3. Illumination
4. Verification

Graham Wallas, "The Art Of Thought", 1926

Notes:

Political scientist

1: problem is investigated consciously, in many directions

2: you put the problem away. Do nothing, or do a different problem. Unconscious processing.

3: the preparation & the incubation come together, and you have a sudden insight.

4: conscious analysis of the idea. Prove it out.

These don't happen in isolation - they very much play together.

## 5 Stages of Creativity

1. Preparation
2. Incubation
3. Illumination
4. Evaluation
5. Elaboration

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

4: vet the idea

5: expand on your new ideas. Test them, refine them, figure out how to best apply them.

> When we intend to solve a problem consciously, we process information in a linear, logical fashion. But when ideas call to each other on their own, **without our leading them down a straight and narrow path**, unexpected combinations may come into being.

TODO: illustration of linear processing

TODO: illustration of parallel processing

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

He even goes on to compare this to parallel computing, right in our wheelhouse:

when we are consciously thinking about a problem, we push it in a linear direction. Like serial processing.

when we let it incubate, it expands to parallel processing.

There's a freedom in your problem solving:

things can combine in ways that your conscious mind would reject.

...

From "Creativity":

The distinction between serial and parallel processing of information may also explain what happens during incubation. In a serial system like that of an old-fashioned calculator, a complex numerical problem must be solved in a sequence, one step at a time. In a parallel system such as in advanced computer software, a problem is broken up into its component steps, the partial computations are carried out simultaneously, and then these are reconstituted into a single final solution. Something similar to parallel processing may be taking place when the elements of a problem are said to be incubating. When we think consciously about an issue, our previous training and the effort to arrive at a solution push our ideas in a linear direction, usually along predictable or familiar lines. But intentionality does not work in the subconscious. Free from rational direction, ideas can combine and pursue each other every which way. Because of this freedom, original connections that would be at first rejected by the rational mind have a chance to become established.

## Set It Aside

Notes:

Often when we're faced with a difficult problem, we think we need to really focus on it.

We think that we are procrastinating if we aren't actively attacking it.

But the truth is, for really complicated problems, where your brain and your creativity need to expand in many directions to find a solution, staying actively focused can be a detriment. Giving your brain some room to explore the space, on its own time, can help you explore ideas that your focused, rational mind would initially reject.

- walk
- work out
- Take a shower
- or a nap.
- Read a book about something unrelated.
- basement - woodworking.
- Knit.
- mountain biking, trail running, rock climbing.

Let your brain expand this problem in many other directions.
