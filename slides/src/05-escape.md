Trail: 3. Escape

## Relax

Notes:

Take a shower, take a nap, ....

When you relax, and shut your brain off from a problem, and let it wander,

other areas of your brain activate, and can find solutions without you trying.

you're also more open-minded to the problem - and less likely to dismiss ideas that don't seem obviously related.

Relaxing is just a great way to be creative.

Trail: 3. Escape

## Physical exercise

Notes:

- Increases blood flow to brain
- improves executive functions
- Improves mood (which can give you the push you need to get back at the problem)
- If rhythmic & repetitive, your mind can shut off & wander

## Other hobbies

Notes:

Similar effects to resting - our brain explores new ideas

this is a very individualized strategy -

ash plays guitar,

maybe you like to draw,

i like to exercise.

## Move on to another problem

Notes:

Put this one aside. Work on something else you know how to solve.

This _feels_ like a more productive version of escaping.

## Why do these work?

Notes:

3 things are happening:

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?

### 1. Escaping can boost your confidence

Notes:

Solving a simpler problem, for example, gives you confidence that you can use to smash the original harder problem.

I do this in rock climbing. I lose confidence working on a hard route.

After completing a couple simple climbs, I can attack the original problem with renewed confidence.

### 2. When you come back to the original problem, you have to re-learn it a bit

Notes:

This can help you challenge assumptions, like talking to the duck.

### 3. Your brain might come up with the answer while thinking about other things

Notes:

There are a couple psychological principles involved:

## Analogical problem solving

Notes:

use information from one domain (the source or analogy)

to help solve a problem in another domain (the target)

...

This happens when you notice parallels between two very different activities;

this prompts you to notice OTHER parallels between them

which can include a reframing of the problem in a way you hadn't before.

## Incubation

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

## 5 Stages of Creativity

1. Preparation
2. Incubation
3. Illumination
4. Evaluation
5. Elaboration

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

popularized by

1: problem is investigated consciously, in many directions

2: you put the problem away. Do nothing, or do a different problem. Subconscious processing.

3: the preparation & the incubation come together, and you have a sudden insight.

4: vet the idea

5: expand on your new ideas. Test them, refine them, figure out how to best apply them.

> ...ideas churn around **below the threshold of consciousness**. It is during this time that **unusual connections** are likely to be made.

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

Mihaly does a great job of describing incubation

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

> When we intend to solve a problem consciously, we process information in a linear, logical fashion. But when ideas call to each other on their own, **without our leading them** down a straight and narrow path, **unexpected combinations** may come into being.

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

_unusual & unexpected_

Notes:

He even goes on to compare this to parallel computing, right in our wheelhouse:

when we are consciously thinking about a problem, we push it in a linear direction.

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/drawings/processing-parallel.png" class="processing" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

when we let it incubate, it expands to parallel processing.

This allows a freedom to your problem solving:

things can combine in ways that your conscious mind would reject.

## Set It Aside

Notes:

Often when we're faced with a difficult problem, we think we need to really focus on it.

We think that we are procrastinating if we aren't actively attacking it.

But the truth is, for really complicated problems, where your brain and your creativity need to expand in many directions to find a solution, staying actively focused can be a detriment. Giving your brain some room to explore the space, on its own time, can help you explore ideas that your focused, rational mind would initially reject.

- walk
- work out
- Take a shower
- or a nap.
- Read a book about something unrelated.
- basement - woodworking.
- Knit.
- mountain biking, trail running, rock climbing.

Let your brain expand this problem in many other directions.
