# Stuck

Notes:

"Stuck" is a nebulous word.

Not very clear.

So I want to be clear about what I mean when I say "stuck".

Stuck is when you've been looking at code for minutes, or hours, or days, that you SWEAR should be working.

You've gone over it many times, and you can't figure out why it's not doing what you think it should be doing.

You've been looking at it so long you're frustrated.

...

My favorite thing in development is the act of getting unstuck,

or helping someone else get unstuck.

when I hear in standup that someone is stuck, my ears perk up.

Over the past few months, I've taken notes about how I and my coworkers get ourselves unstuck, and I want to share some tips with you.

...

My first strategy is...only kind of a strategy.
