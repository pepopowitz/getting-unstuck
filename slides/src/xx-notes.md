Schemas -

Although any drawing could be called a schema, here we will refer to schema as a concept which a child arrives at which he repeats again and again when no intentional experience influences him

Isolation - A system of code is like a santa mask craft project.
You combine a popsicle stick, a paper plate, construction paper, and cotton balls to make this final beautiful product. These are your dependencies - whether internal or external.
Glue holds it together, just like the code you write to tie the dependencies.

We don't know where the problem is. Maybe it's in the glue. Maybe the cotton balls react with the glue. Maybe the paper plate and construction paper were never intended to be used in the same project, and made competing assumptions that will prevent them from every working together.

Code removal starts with your finished santa mask, and tries to prune things until it can find the culprit.

A proof of concept starts with the bare materials - a cotton ball, a paper plate, a square of construction paper - and you try to piece it together with as little glue as possible, to prove that the paper plate and construction paper made competing assumptions.

how do i get custom favicons? I can't edit the html.

<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">

TODO: add to "isolate" something about breaking things on purpose - i.e. trying to get "good red", so you can prove that you understand the system.

Harden: Focus on the PROCESS, not the result. Journal the things you complete; get excited about following your process.

Harden: Get in the reps. As Ash says, "coding takes practice, but that's all it takes."

Embrace: Success is the end-state of a long series of failures; it might NOT even be the end-state. Learning might be the end-state.
