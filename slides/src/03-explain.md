## Talk to the duck

![Talk to the duck](/images/drawings/talk-to-the-duck.png)

Notes:

Explain what it is

Comes from a story in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer

Doesn't have to be to a duck

Doesn't have to be to a real THING
But it _can_ be a real thing

it can be imaginary

But it is definitely most effective when it is out loud

Explain the problem to the duck.

Walk them through the code. Out loud.

...

the duck can be a fake thing...

## Talk to a person

Notes:

TODO: pic: coworker in a duck costume?

Or it can be a real thing.

Same thing as before, except your coworkers are the duck

Ask them to come look over your shoulder

Explain the problem,

what is/isn't happening,

and walk them through the code.

Trail: 1. Explain

## Pair with a person

Notes:

Taking "talk to a person in a duck costume" a step further

we pair a TON at artsy

not all the time - that can overwhelm people

but a couple hours a day works really great for tricky problems.

## Protege Effect

### The best way to learn or understand something is to teach it.

Notes:

if you've ever taught someone something,

through 1on1, or a lunch n learn, or a workshop, or teaching interns,

you've seen this.

A couple things that happen when you're teaching something:

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Protege Effect

### Inspires you to learn the topic thoroughly

Notes:

Because you're going to have to explain it,

& you don't want to look a fool,

you use better learning strategies.

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Protege Effect

### Forces you to think more about how things are all fitting together, so you can explain it clearly

Notes:

...

It also has a meta effect - while learning, you're thinking about **how** you're learning

and how others might best learn it

Psychologists call this "metacognitive processing".

Notes:

Interesting thing about the protege effect is that you don't actually have to teach for it to work for you -

you just have to EXPECT to teach

This is from a study from 2016 demonstrating the protege effect

## Challenge assumptions

Notes:

The other thing that happens when you explain something to someone:

To prove that the code you think is running is actually running

...

IMO, This is the most critical and important thing about ALL of these "explanation" strategies:

They prompt you to challenge assumptions.

> "Experience this one thing for what it is, not what you think it is."

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

this makes me think about some ideas from Mihaly.

Mihaly - wrote "Creativity"

psychologist who introduces concept of "Flow"

it's kind of philosophical, almost zen

....

this is similar to what I remember being taught in art class

And what my kids are learning about their art

Viktor Lowenfeld's Stages Of Artistic Development, 1949

Notes:

I want to focus on the 3rd and 4th stages - which is when a young artist - or sometimes a 41 year old artist, like myself - transitions from drawing schemas, or symbols, to realism.

## Schematic

Notes:

Are really just symbols

visual heuristics, kind of

When we see this drawing, we recognize it instantly as an eye

And when you ask me to draw an eye, as a child in the schematic stage, this is what I'd draw.

## Schematic vs. Realistic

Notes:

But then the artist transitions to realism

And this is what an eye ACTUALLY looks like

It's not a symbol, or a heuristic

It has incredible detail and subtlety.

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/drawings/deps-0-complex.png" class="deps-complex" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

When you are focused on a problem in your code, you use symbols.

You make assumptions.

You build up this model in your head of all the pieces that are working together.

We treat them in our head as black boxes.

They are symbols, and you just assume they work as intended.

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/drawings/deps-1-complex.png" class="deps-complex" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

But behind each black box lies complexity & detail

...

We _have_ to treat them as black boxes, though -

because if we didn't....

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Challenge Assumptions,Schemas & Symbols

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/drawings/deps-all-complex.png" class="deps-complex" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

We couldn't possibly understand the system. There would just be too much going on.

Too many details.

But our black boxes don't always work as intended.

Explaining the problem forces you to evaluate every assumption and every black box, and explore the details of each of them.

And that's when you uncover the issue.
