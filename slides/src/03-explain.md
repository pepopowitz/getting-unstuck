## Talk to the duck

Pic: duck

Notes:

Explain what it is

Comes from a story in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer

Doesn't have to be to a duck

Doesn't have to be to a real THING
But it _can_ be a real thing

it can be imaginary

But it is definitely most effective when it is out loud

## Talk to a person

Notes:

Same thing as before, except your coworkers are the duck
Pic: person in a duck costume

Just ask if you can explain something to them

## Challenge assumptions

Notes:

This is the most critical and important thing about ALL of these "explanation" strategies:

They prompt you to challenge assumptions.

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention"

Notes:

Mihaly - wrote "Creativity"

psychologist who introduces concept of "Flow"

it's kind of philosophical, almost zen

....

this is similar to what I remember being taught in art class

And what my kids are learning about their art

Viktor Lowenfeld's Stages Of Artistic Development, 1949

Notes:

I want to focus on the 3rd and 4th stages - which is when a young artist - or sometimes a 41 year old artist, like myself - transitions from drawing schemas, or symbols, to realism.

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?

### Schemas

TODO: pic of schematic drawing

Notes:

Are really just symbols

visual heuristics, kind of

When we see this drawing, we recognize it instantly as an eye

And when you ask me to draw an eye, as a child in the schematic stage, this is what I'd draw.

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?

### Schemas -> Realism

TODO: pic of schematic drawing
TODO: pic of realistic drawing

Notes:

But then the artist transitions to realism

And this is what an eye ACTUALLY looks like

It's not a symbol, or a heuristic

It has incredible detail and subtlety.

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Schemas & Symbols

TODO: pic of biz-logic, settings, db, mail as symbols

Notes:

When you are focused on a problem in your code, you use symbols.

You make assumptions.

You build up this model in your head of all the pieces that are working together.

But they are black boxes.

They are symbols in your head, and you just assume they work as intended.

...

We _have_ to do this - because if we didn't....

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Schemas & Symbols

TODO: pic of focus other blocks, one at a time?

Notes:

We couldn't possibly understand the system. There would just be too much going on.

Too many details.

But our black boxes don't always work as intended.

Explaining the problem forces you to evaluate every assumption and every black box, and expand the details of each of them.

Until you can identify what's not working right.
