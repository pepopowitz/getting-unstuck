# Stuck

Notes:

"Stuck" is a nebulous word.

Not very clear.

So I want to be clear about what I mean when I say "stuck".

Stuck is when you've been looking at code for minutes, or hours, or days, that you SWEAR should be working.

You've gone over it many times, and you can't figure out why it's not doing what you think it should be doing.

You've been looking at it so long you're frustrated.

...

My favorite thing in development is the act of getting unstuck,

or helping someone else get unstuck.

when I hear in standup that someone is stuck, my ears perk up.

Over the past few months, I've taken notes about how I and my coworkers get ourselves unstuck, and I want to share some tips with you.

...

My first strategy is...only kind of a strategy.

Will Doenlen, ["To start meditating, stop trying to empty your mind"](https://medium.com/@williardx/to-start-meditating-stop-trying-to-empty-your-mind-fe67a7ed113b)

Notes:

My friend Will wrote an article called "To start meditating, stop trying to empty your mind"

Many newcomers to meditation think that they are bad at it, because their mind is not empty.

Their mind wanders, and they think about lots of different things.

...

Will makes the point that HAVING an empty mind is not what mediation is about, especially as a beginner.

It is about _mindfulness_, and noticing that your mind is wandering.

And that's it. (read quote)

So it's okay to be stuck - that's just you doing your job -

which is to solve problems, not commit lines of code.

## Talk to the duck

![Talk to the duck](/images/drawings/talk-to-the-duck.png)

Notes:

Explain what it is

Comes from a story in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer

Doesn't have to be to a duck

Doesn't have to be to a real THING
But it _can_ be a real thing

it can be imaginary

But it is definitely most effective when it is out loud

Explain the problem to the duck.

Walk them through the code. Out loud.

## Talk to a person

Notes:

TODO: pic: coworker in a duck costume?

Or it can be a real thing.

Same thing as before, except your coworkers are the duck

Ask them to come look over your shoulder

Explain the problem,

what is/isn't happening,

and walk them through the code.

## Pair with a person

Notes:

Taking "talk to a person in a duck costume" a step further

you've seen this.

Notes:

### Forces you to think more about how things are all fitting together, so you can explain it clearly

Notes:

...

It also has a meta effect - while learning, you're thinking about **how** you're learning

and how others might best learn it

Psychologists call this "metacognitive processing".

Notes:

Interesting thing about the protege effect is that you don't actually have to teach for it to work for you -

you just have to EXPECT to teach

Notes:

The other thing that happens when you explain something to someone:

They prompt you to challenge assumptions.

## Schematic

Notes:

And when you ask me to draw an eye, as a child in the schematic stage, this is what I'd draw.

Notes:

When you are focused on a problem in your code, you use symbols.

You make assumptions.

You build up this model in your head of all the pieces that are working together.

We treat them in our head as black boxes.

They are symbols, and you just assume they work as intended.

We _have_ to treat them as black boxes, though -

Notes:

We couldn't possibly understand the system. There would just be too much going on.

Too many details.

But our black boxes don't always work as intended.

Explaining the problem forces you to evaluate every assumption and every black box, and explore the details of each of them.

And that's when you uncover the issue.

Side note - this is one reason that small commits is really helpful.

## Build a proof of concept

Notes:

A binary search for the problematic code starts with a system of code, and prunes it.

An alternative approach is to start from scratch, and try to recreate the system as simply as possible,

building a proof of concept that these pieces should play together nicely.

...

This is often what you'll do when you're getting ready to submit an issue to a project

Build a proof of concept that demonstrates the problem, so it's easier to identify/fix the bug

And it gives you information about how this system will eventually come together.

## Log inputs

Notes:

Your code is a tree of function calls.

Somewhere along the way, one of the functions isn't getting what it needs.

Log inputs to them, to see who doesn't have what they need!

This is not an advanced tactic. It's something we learn to do pretty early as developers.

But you'd be surprised how many times you get stuck on a problem, and you forget that this will help you isolate the issue.

## Write tests!

Notes:

I get preachy about writing tests

It's one of the most useful skills for breaking down a problem.

cuz testing is the best way to tighten your development feedback loop

of making changes, observing their effects, and repeating the cycle.

Without tests, your loop can be loose - it could be weeks or months before you see your code deployed and know if it worked.

With tests, your loop can be as tight as a couple seconds.

...

A few ways automated tests can help you isolate an issue:

## Relax

Notes:

Take a shower, take a nap, ....

When you relax, and shut your brain off from a problem, and let it wander,

other areas of your brain activate, and can find solutions without you trying.

you're also more open-minded to the problem - and less likely to dismiss ideas that don't seem obviously related.

Relaxing is just a great way to be creative.

this prompts you to notice OTHER parallels between them

Notes:

He even goes on to compare this to parallel computing, right in our wheelhouse:

when we are consciously thinking about a problem, we push it in a linear direction.

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/drawings/processing-parallel.png" class="processing" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

when we let it incubate, it expands to parallel processing.

This allows a freedom to your problem solving:

things can combine in ways that your conscious mind would reject.

...

From "Creativity":

The distinction between serial and parallel processing of information may also explain what happens during incubation. In a serial system like that of an old-fashioned calculator, a complex numerical problem must be solved in a sequence, one step at a time. In a parallel system such as in advanced computer software, a problem is broken up into its component steps, the partial computations are carried out simultaneously, and then these are reconstituted into a single final solution. Something similar to parallel processing may be taking place when the elements of a problem are said to be incubating. When we think consciously about an issue, our previous training and the effort to arrive at a solution push our ideas in a linear direction, usually along predictable or familiar lines. But intentionality does not work in the subconscious. Free from rational direction, ideas can combine and pursue each other every which way. Because of this freedom, original connections that would be at first rejected by the rational mind have a chance to become established.

## Set It Aside

Notes:

Often when we're faced with a difficult problem, we think we need to really focus on it.

We think that we are procrastinating if we aren't actively attacking it.

But the truth is, for really complicated problems, where your brain and your creativity need to expand in many directions to find a solution, staying actively focused can be a detriment. Giving your brain some room to explore the space, on its own time, can help you explore ideas that your focused, rational mind would initially reject.

- walk
- work out
- Take a shower
- or a nap.
- Read a book about something unrelated.
- basement - woodworking.
- Knit.
- mountain biking, trail running, rock climbing.

Let your brain expand this problem in many other directions.
