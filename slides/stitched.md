NYC, MKE

our mission is to expand the art market,

and we're doing that with a platform for collecting and discovering art.

...

I wrote my first line of Ruby code 6 months ago.

I'm brand new to your community!

I come from JS, and a lot of .NET before that

Some things I've noticed about the Ruby & Rails community so far:

you can just say

# Stuck

Notes:

"Stuck" is a nebulous word.

Not very clear.

So I want to be clear about what I mean when I say "stuck".

Stuck is when you've been looking at code for minutes, or hours, or days, that you SWEAR should be working.

You've gone over it many times, and you can't figure out why it's not doing what you think it should be doing.

You've been looking at it so long you're frustrated.

...

My favorite thing in development is the act of getting unstuck,

or helping someone else get unstuck.

when I hear in standup that someone is stuck, my ears perk up.

Over the past few months, I've taken notes about how I and my coworkers get ourselves unstuck, and I want to share some tips with you.

2. Who in this room can think of a time that they were stuck?

Will Doenlen, ["To start meditating, stop trying to empty your mind"](https://medium.com/@williardx/to-start-meditating-stop-trying-to-empty-your-mind-fe67a7ed113b)

Notes:

My friend Will wrote an article called "To start meditating, stop trying to empty your mind"

Many newcomers to meditation think that they are bad at it, because their mind is not empty.

Their mind wanders, and they think about lots of different things.

...

Will makes the point that HAVING an empty mind is not what mediation is about, especially as a beginner.

It is about _mindfulness_, and noticing that your mind is wandering.

And that's it. (read quote)

Similarly, when it comes to getting stuck....

## Talk to the duck

![Talk to the duck](/images/drawings/talk-to-the-duck.png)

Notes:

Explain what it is

Comes from a story in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer

Doesn't have to be to a duck

Doesn't have to be to a real THING
But it _can_ be a real thing

it can be imaginary

But it is definitely most effective when it is out loud

Explain the problem to the duck.

Walk them through the code. Out loud.

...

the duck can be a fake thing...

## Talk to a person

Notes:

TODO: pic: coworker in a duck costume?

Or it can be a real thing.

Same thing as before, except your coworkers are the duck

Ask them to come look over your shoulder

Explain the problem,

what is/isn't happening,

and walk them through the code.

## Pair with a person

Notes:

Taking "talk to a person in a duck costume" a step further

we pair a TON at artsy

## Protege Effect

### The best way to learn or understand something is to teach it.

Notes:

if you've ever taught someone something,

through 1on1, or a lunch n learn, or a workshop, or teaching interns,

you've seen this.

A couple things that happen when you're teaching something:

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Protege Effect

### Inspires you to learn the topic thoroughly

Notes:

Because you're going to have to explain it,

& you don't want to look a fool,

you use better learning strategies.

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Protege Effect

### Inspires you to think about how you'd learn the topic

Notes:

...

It also has a meta effect - while learning, you're thinking about **how** you're learning

and how others might best learn it

Psychologists call this "metacognitive processing".

---

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Protege Effect

> ...students in the learning by **preparing to teach** intervention developed a more detailed and better-organized concept map of the problem...

[Muis, Krista, et al. "Learning by preparing to teach: Fostering self-regulatory processes and achievement during complex mathematics problem solving."](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fedu0000071)

Notes:

This is from a study from 2016 demonstrating the protege effect

- Control: learn these things
- experiment: Learn these things knowing you'll have to teach it

Notes:

I want to zoom in on that large quote I just had up there.

It refers to the experiment group as the "learning by preparing to teach" group

They never _actually_ taught it

Neat thing about the protege effect is that you don't actually have to teach for it to work for you -

you just have to EXPECT to teach

## Challenge assumptions

Notes:

The other thing that happens when you explain something to someone:

To prove that the code you think is running is actually running

...

IMO, This is the most critical and important thing about ALL of these "explanation" strategies:

They prompt you to challenge assumptions.

Trail: 1. Explain,Why?,Challenge Assumptions

> "Experience this one thing for what it is, not what you think it is."

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

this makes me think about some ideas from Mihaly.

Mihaly - wrote "Creativity"

psychologist who introduces concept of "Flow"

it's kind of philosophical, almost zen

this is similar to what I remember being taught in art class

And what my kids are learning about their art

Notes:

When we see this drawing, we recognize it instantly as an eye

But that's not what an eye looks like.

That's just a _symbol_ of an eye. A shortcut, or a heuristic.

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/drawings/deps-0-complex.png" class="deps-complex" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

When you are focused on a problem in your code, you use symbols.

You make assumptions.

You build up this model in your head of all the pieces that are working together.

We treat them in our head as black boxes.

They are symbols, and you just assume they work as intended.

Notes:

We couldn't possibly understand the system. There would just be too much going on.

Too many details.

But our black boxes don't always work as intended.

Explaining the problem forces you to evaluate every assumption and every black box, and explore the details of each of them.

And that's when you uncover the issue.

Notes:

Isolating the problem starts with some risk analysis.

Ask yourself some questions

there is a good chance that's where your stuck is coming from.

Common thread for "isolation" strategies ^^^

Help break a problem down from something large to something small

When it has a smaller surface area, it's easier to figure out.

Trail: 3. Escape

## Relax

Notes:

Take a shower, take a nap, ....

When you relax, and shut your brain off from a problem, and let it wander,

other areas of your brain activate, and can find solutions without you trying.

you're also more open-minded to the problem - and less likely to dismiss ideas that don't seem obviously related.

Relaxing is just a great way to be creative.

Trail: 3. Escape

## Physical exercise

Notes:

- Increases blood flow to brain
- improves executive functions
- Improves mood (which can give you the push you need to get back at the problem)
- If rhythmic & repetitive, your mind can shut off & wander

## Other hobbies

Notes:

Similar effects to resting - our brain explores new ideas

this is a very individualized strategy -

ash plays guitar,

maybe you like to draw,

i like to exercise.

Trail: 3. Escape

## Move on to another problem

Notes:

Put this one aside. Work on something else you know how to solve.

This _feels_ like a more productive version of escaping.

Trail: 3. Escape

## Why do these work?

Notes:

3 things are happening:

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?

### 1. Escaping can boost your confidence

Notes:

Solving a simpler problem, for example, gives you confidence that you can use to smash the original harder problem.

I do this in rock climbing. I lose confidence working on a hard route.

After completing a couple simple climbs, I can attack the original problem with renewed confidence.

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?

### 2. When you come back to the original problem, you have to re-learn it a bit

Notes:

This can help you challenge assumptions, like talking to the duck.

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?

### 3. Your brain might come up with the answer while thinking about other things

Notes:

There are a couple psychological principles involved:

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?

## Analogical problem solving

Notes:

use information from one domain (the source or analogy)

to help solve a problem in another domain (the target)

http://cognitivepsychology.wikidot.com/problem-solving:analogy

...

This happens when you notice parallels between two very different activities;

this prompts you to notice OTHER parallels between them

which can include a reframing of the problem in a way you hadn't before.

## Incubation

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

## 4 Stages of Creativity

1. Preparation
2. Incubation
3. Illumination
4. Verification

Graham Wallas, "The Art Of Thought", 1926

Notes:

Originally described

Political scientist

1: problem is investigated consciously, in many directions

2: you put the problem away. Do nothing, or do a different problem. Subconscious processing.

3: the preparation & the incubation come together, and you have a sudden insight.

4: conscious analysis of the idea. Prove it out.

These don't happen in isolation - they very much play together.

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

## 5 Stages of Creativity

1. Preparation
2. Incubation
3. Illumination
4. Evaluation
5. Elaboration

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

More recently,

popularized by

1-3 the same

4: vet the idea

5: expand on your new ideas. Test them, refine them, figure out how to best apply them.

...

Mihaly describes incubation really well:

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

> ...ideas churn around **below the threshold of consciousness**. It is during this time that **unusual connections** are likely to be made.

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

Mihaly does a great job of describing incubation

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

> When we intend to solve a problem consciously, we process information in a linear, logical fashion. But when ideas call to each other on their own, **without our leading them** down a straight and narrow path, **unexpected combinations** may come into being.

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Intervention", 1997

Notes:

_unusual & unexpected_

Notes:

He even goes on to compare this to parallel computing, right in our wheelhouse:

when we are consciously thinking about a problem, we push it in a linear direction.

---

Trail: 3. Escape, Why?, Incubation

<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/drawings/processing-parallel.png" class="processing" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

when we let it incubate, it expands to parallel processing.

This allows a freedom to your problem solving:

things can combine in ways that your conscious mind would reject.

Trail: 3. Escape

## Set It Aside

Notes:

Often when we're faced with a difficult problem, we think we need to really focus on it.

We think that we are procrastinating if we aren't actively attacking it.

But the truth is, for really complicated problems, where your brain and your creativity need to expand in many directions to find a solution, staying actively focused can be a detriment. Giving your brain some room to explore the space, on its own time, can help you explore ideas that your focused, rational mind would initially reject.

- walk
- work out
- Take a shower
- or a nap.
- Read a book about something unrelated.
- basement - woodworking.
- Knit.
- mountain biking, trail running, rock climbing.

Let your brain expand this problem in many other directions.

## Wall of motivation

Notes:

I keep a trello board that I fill with messages of appreciation & thanks, and I look back on it now and then.

Because let's face it - when you get stuck, your self-talk changes for the worse.

You start doubting yourself. You start saying awful things about yourself. Your impostor syndrome kicks in hard.

A wall of motivation can **replenish your ego**

## Keep a journal

Notes:

Another of my coworkers, Eloy, who lives on a houseboat in Amsterdam,

recommended when I first started at Artsy to keep a journal

of things I did every day - so I could see that I **AM** getting things done.

Sometimes they aren't things I can check off a list,

but they are times when I knew I was doing my job of solving problems.

## Exercise

Notes:

Can reduce anxiety & depression

I particularly recommend rock climbing

Hardens your problem solving skills & persistence.

---

Trail: 4. Harden

## Meditation

Notes:

Variety of mental & physical benefits

Especially leveling your emotions, which can factor into getting stuck

and increases your ability to persist through challenges

---

Trail: 4. Harden

## Talk about your struggles

Notes:

Get outside of your head.

Do more active 1on1's with your leader, or someone else that you feel psychologically safe around.

Someone you can be vulnerable with.

Talk about the times you felt stuck.

Get in the reps

Strengthen yourself

Professional athletes condition themselves for incredible physical challenges.

Professional developers need to condition themselves for incredible mental challenges.
